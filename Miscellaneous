[1] Why do we need a 'return 0' ?
    - In C programs the main function is of type int and therefore it should return an integer value.
    - The return value of the main function is considered the "Exit Status" of the application. 
    - On most operating systems returning 0 is a success status like saying "The program worked fine".
 
[2] What is the difference between logical and Bitwise AND operator?
    - The logical and operator ‘&&’ expects its operands to be boolean expressions (either 1 or 0) and returns a boolean value.
    - The bitwise and operator ‘&’ works on Integral (short, int, unsigned, char, bool, unsigned char, long) values 
      and return Integral value.
