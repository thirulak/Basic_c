[1] Why do we need a 'return 0' ?
    - In C programs the main function is of type int and therefore it should return an integer value.
    - The return value of the main function is considered the "Exit Status" of the application. 
    - On most operating systems returning 0 is a success status like saying "The program worked fine".
